## Gozer[^1] Install Instructions

### Install

Starting from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
	`sudo apt-get install dnsmasq`
	`sudo apt-get install iptables`
	`sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent`
	`sudo apt-get install vsftpd` 

### Configure

#### Config Files

Modify/copy the `dnsmasq.conf` and `vsftpd.conf` to match the files provided here. We also need to copy over the `dhclient_enx.service`` file that will run the dhcclient service for the "external" interface. Be sure to modify these configs with the correct interface names. In the sample configs provided here the interfaces are: 
    Internal:`eno1`
    External:`enx00e04c3613f7`

#### Networking

Modify `/etc/sysctl.conf` by adding/uncommenting `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. This tells Ubuntu to forward packets not meant for us instead of discarding them.
`sudo sysctl -p` to reload the config.
You will also need to modify the netplan configuration for the interface that will be "internal" the name of the interfaces will vary. This will be specific to your install and should be partially generated by the install process. The important thing is to turn off DHCP, set a static IP and set that IP to the gateway for that network.
```
network:
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: false
      addresses: [192.168.2.1/24]
      routes:
        - to: 0.0.0.0/0
          via: 192.168.2.1
    enx00e04c3613f7:
      dhcp4: true
  version: 2
```

#### `iptables` Rules

Rules:
`sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enx00e04c3613f7 -j MASQUERADE`

This makes the rules persistent and reloads the saved rules.
`sudo netfilter-persistent save`
`sudo netfilter-persistent reload`

#### Enable/Disable System Services

`sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved`
`sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved`
`sudo systemctl enable dhclient_enx.service`
`sudo systemctl start dhclient_enx.service`
`sudo systemctl start dnsmasq`
`sudo systemctl enable iptables`
`sudo systemctl start iptables`

#### PXE files

create directory to hold the necessary files for PXE booting (`sudo mkdir /var/ftpd`). Copy over the contents of the `vsftpd` folder to the file you created. Links needs to be created in `/var/ftpd`:  
 
 - `sudo ln -s /var/ftpd/debian-installer/amd64/pxelinux.0 /var/ftpd/pxelinux.0`
 - `sudo ln -s /var/ftpd/debian-installer/amd64/pxelinux.0 /var/ftpd/pxelinux.cfg`
 - `sudo ln -s debian-installer/amd64/grubx64.efi .`
 - `sudo ln -s debian-installer/amd64/grub .`
 
The perms need to be set to correctly allow the PXE client to read/execute files: `chmod 755 -R /var/ftpd`.
rebooting the system should start all the correct services you can check necessary services are running with:

`sudo systemctl status vsftpd`
`sudo systemctl status dnsmasq`
`sudo systemctl status iptables`
`sudo systemctl status dhclient_enx`

To observe the PXE process:

 - set client up for Legacy PXE booting(iPXE/UEFI PXE is unreliable)
 - attach client to "internal" interface and boot
 - on appliance run `journalctl -xef | grep dnsmasq` to observe the boot process. 

 Once the client begins the PXE process it will automatically configure itself to install Proxmox ontop of Debian, then join or create a Proxmox cluster on the network.
